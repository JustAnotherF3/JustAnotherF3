- Hello, I’m @JustAnotherF3 or JustF3, NotF3, or AF3!
- My interests are Object shows, (One, TDOS, TPOT ect.) Geometry dash, and other things!
- I’m currently learning python, as it is one of the easiest programming languages.
- I’m looking to collaborate on a (stupid idea alert) Windows XP style RPG, sort of like Miitopia for the Nintendo Switch.
- My discord is @notf3. (pls let me know you are from github that way i know i can maybe trust you cause some people are just weird)
- I go by anything but she/her.
- Fun fact: (meh fact) I am pansexual. (not a very fun fact) my knee sometimes pops and i start crying and laughing hysterically.

bye! <3
